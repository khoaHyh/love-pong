# README for love-pong project

This project was created for the cs50 2020 course as part of the 'Game' track. I implemented an AI with two difficulty settings. 

* How to run:
  * Download the project as a zip file.
  * Unzip the file onto your computer.
  * Navigate to the "love-pong" folder and find the "pong.exe" file
  * Execute the pong.exe file to play
  
  
* Instructions on how to play
  * Press '1' to enter the game as Player 1
  * Press '2' to enter the game as Player 2
  * If you press '1' and do not press '2' then you will be Player 1 and the AI will be Player 2
  * Press 'e' for easy AI
  * Press 'h' for 'not easy' AI
  * You may toggle the difficulty mid-game by pressing the buttons for the respective difficulty you desire.
  * The game is to 10 points.
  * That is all. Press 'Enter' or 'Return' to play!
